# craft (craftlang) - Design mockup

craft is a website for a fake programming language that I came up with. It doesn't exist. However, [craftlang](https://github.com/craftlang/craftlangc) does exist.

### Design

I designed this in Figma, and built it using TailwindCSS.

### Build

To build this in a development environment, use `npm run dev`. This adds a lot unneeded of CSS to the output file ([learn more here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production)).

To build for production, use `npm run build`. This tree-shakes the unneeded CSS to make it much smaller.

### View
